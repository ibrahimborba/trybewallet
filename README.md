# Notes
### Git and Commit
- There are only two branches since this is a solo project. One is the *main*, with production ready features. And the other one is *project_refactor*, where I improve the code and add new features.
- This project used the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with some types from [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).


### Further Improvements
- Increase test coverage
- Make it *Mobile First*
- Add *Design Pattern* for API requests
- Break *Wallet Page* form, table and table rows into components 
- Optmize *Styled Components* and dark/light mode structure

---

# Lint
The project was developed following the Clean Code standards specified by Airbnb's [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) and [StyleLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-airbnb) rules, since it's one of the most implemented lint packages.

Some minor configuration changes were made to better fit [Trybe's Lint](https://github.com/betrybe/eslint-config-trybe), because the project was initially developed following said rules.
